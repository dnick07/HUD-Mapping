# HUD-Mapping
A map tying together relationships between different HUD data sets.

What I am trying to accomplish is a base map of Qualified Census Tracts (QCTs) across the United States.  From there, I'd like to overlay both the Fair Market Rents for each area of the United States, as well as the pinpoint locations of the MF_Properties_With_Assistance.

I am a novice and do not know how to alter these data sets to reflect what needs to be shown in the Kepler.gl application.

Please help if you can.

Thanks!
